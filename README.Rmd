## Seasonal curves 

Repo contains aggregate, non-identifiable nutrition data from 25 geographic regions (*upazilas*) of Bangladesh. Curves constructed track the "hunger season" noted in literature. One of my research objectives at IRI was to investigate the relationship between seasonal climate and hunger/wasting.

### Mid-2019
Creating seasonal curves for Dr. Tatiana Gumucio's presentation at Global CSA Conference 2019, Bali, Indonesia

### Late 2020
Using these seasonal wasting plots for a manuscript in-preparation for submission to WHO Bulletin.
